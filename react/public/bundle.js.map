The most basic version is as follows: We are given n jobs J1, J2, ..., Jn of varying processing times, which need to be scheduled on m machines with varying processing power, while trying to minimize the makespan. The makespan is the total length of the schedule (that is, when all the jobs have finished processing). In most practical settings, the problem is presented as an online problem (dynamic scheduling), that is, the decision of scheduling a job can only be made online, when the job is presented to the algorithm. \r\n\t  \t\t\t\t</h3>\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t<h3 className=\"offering-description-div\">\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t\tProduction scheduling can be defined as the allocation of available production resources over time to perform a collection of tasks. It is an important decision-making process in the operation level. In a modern manufacturing environment, many scheduling problems occur. Most of the scheduling problems are very significant and hard to solve owing to the complex nature of the problems.\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t</h3>\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t<h3 className=\"offering-description-div\">\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t\tThe scheduling problem is the classical quantitative combinatorial search problem of defining order over a set of N jobs as they proceed from one machine to another. Many industrial processes are characterized by this flow of work such as jobs in metallurgy, metal and automotive plants. A flowshop consists of M machines in series and N different jobs available for processing at time zero. Each machine can handle only one job at a time. Each job is continuously processed on M available machines in the same technological order. The processing time including a setup time of job performed on the machine depends on the amount of constrained resources allocated to these jobs. The processing time of job i on machine j is denoted by T[ij] for i = 1, 2, …, N and j = 1, 2, …, M.\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t</h3>\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t<h3 className=\"offering-description-div\">\r\n\t  \t\t\t\tRead more: <a className=\"inline-hyperlink\" target=\"blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_shop_scheduling\">Job Shop Scheduling</a> \r\n\t  \t\t\t\t</h3>\r\n\t  \t\t\t</ToggleShowHideComponent>\r\n\t  \t\t\t<ToggleShowHideComponent show={false} title={\"The Traveling Salesman Problem\"}>\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t<h3 className=\"offering-description-div\">\t\t\r\n\t  \t\t\t\t\tThe travelling salesman problem (TSP), or in recent years, the travelling salesperson problem, asks the following question: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?\".
