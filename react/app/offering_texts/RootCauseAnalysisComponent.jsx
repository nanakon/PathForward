  						<h3 className="offering-description-div">
  							<ul>
  								<li>Why most problem-solving models don’t get to the root cause, and a solution</li>
                  <li>How to ensure that the right problem is being worked on</li>
                  <li>Tools for priority setting</li>
                  <li>Developing a clear and sufficient problem statement</li> 
                  <li>Creating a SIPOC diagram to scope the effort and define interrelationships</li>
                  <li>Using flowcharts to drill down into the right part of the process</li> 
                  <li>Identifying possible causes</li>
                  <li>Options for selecting or eliminating causes (nominal group techniques)</li>
