                        Agile has been one of the big buzzwords of the IT development industry for the last 10 years. But exactly what <span className="italic">is</span> agile development?  Put simply, agile development is a different way of managing IT development teams and projects.

                      <h3 className="offering-description-div">
                        Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach that builds products or services incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.  It works by breaking projects down into smaller sizes of user functionality, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short one to four-week cycles.
